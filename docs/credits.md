This project was built from the ground up — architecture, planner, orchestrator, tool registry model, metadata schema, execution trace format, fault‑tolerance model, and the broader goal of pushing AI systems beyond chatbot‑style reasoning into deterministic, compiler‑like automation.

## Vision

Smith was created to eliminate the repetitive overhead of building agents by hand — chaining tools manually, rewriting logic for every feature, and patching prompts every time capabilities change. The goal is simple:

Write tools, not agents.
Smith handles the rest — planning, ordering, execution, retries, safety, and synthesis — without improvisation.

## Influences

The project draws conceptual inspiration from:

* Operating system runtimes (deterministic system calls)
* Compiler pipelines (parse → validate → execute)
* MLOps safety patterns (timeouts, retries, metadata‑driven execution)

But all design, implementation, and iteration were done independently.

## Contributors

Currently a solo‑maintained project.
Future contributions will be credited here when the system transitions from personal research to full open‑source ecosystem.

## License

Project Smith is released under the MIT License.
This allows commercial and personal use with attribution while encouraging open improvement.

If Smith ever grows into a larger foundation or community project, this file will evolve from a credit page to a real contributor ledger — the same way the system itself evolves from new tools rather than new agents.
